# Caesar Cipher in Java!
## Fun program that encrypts your messages.

This project was my first introduction to cryptography. The point of this project was to get familiar with the basic concept and to practice the programming skills I am developing.

## How to run:
1. Make sure you have JDK installed on your device. (https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
1. Open command prompt and go to the directory where you've saved the java file. (E.g. C:\Users\UserName\Downloads\fileName.java)
1. Compile with the 'javac fileName.java' command.
1. Once compiled. Run with the 'java fileName' command.

## What's next?
Well, now that I have created a Caesar Cipher. My next plan is to create a code that breaks the Cipher. 

UPDATE: The code to break the Cipher is now available at: https://github.com/Val-Resh/BreakingCaesarCipher_Java
